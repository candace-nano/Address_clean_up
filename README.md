Written using Oracle. 
Intended to be validated with a USPS address verification tool after this code has been run. Will not yield perfect results as it doesn't account for typos or addresses written out of order (something written as "STE 100 BLDG 1" will not get the STE number pulled over into the second address line column. It should be written like "BLDG 1 STE 100").
